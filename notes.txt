                            I've done some basic setup of the Project
                            --> Created console application with basic logic;
                            --> Created a README.md file and inserted some info in the template
                            --> Created a Github repo;
                            --> Created this file for general notes and ideas

                        The basic functionality of application are as follows:
                            1. The application loads.
                            2. After loading, a menu with three options are displayed:
                                    * Write text to file;
                                    * Read text from file; and
                                    * Exit.
                            3. The user is then prompted to select an option from the menu.
                            4. If user selects to write text to file:
                                    * The user is then prompted to enter a title for the intended text string and confirm it;
                                    * Now the user is prompted to enter a text string related to the title and confirm it;
                                    * The information is written to a file, and the user is prompted to return to the menu;
                            5. If user selects to read text from a file:
                                    * The various titles written to file are displayed to the user to select from;
                                    * Once the user selects a valid title, the said title and its corresponding text is displayed on screen;
                                    * The user is then prompted to return to the menu.
                            6. If user selects to exit:
                                    * The application stops and close the console application.

                        Realised that the basic menu options should change to include a delete function as well.
                        It's no good that you are able to add items and view those items, but are not able to delete
                        it as well.

                        Menu options should read:

                            * Create a new text item;
                            * Delete a text item;
                            * View a text item; and
                            * Exit.
